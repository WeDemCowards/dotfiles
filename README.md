# A place for my dotfiles to live
Just some of my config files, nothing much else to see here...

If you find yourself here by chance let me assure you that copying my figgies is a **bad idea**. This shit is terrible. The only reason this repo is public is for conveniences sake.

If for some reason you want to use them, here's the software they are for:
- neovim
- i3
- picom
- rxvt
- zsh

There are some references to scripts that are not included in this repository.

## To do: 
- [ ] Make these more universal so you don't have to make minor edits every time you use them
- [ ] Maybe make a script that will install all of these into a home folder *all easy like*
