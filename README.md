# A place for my dotfiles to live
Just some of my config files, nothing much else to see here...

To do: 
- Pick a solution for your config files:
	- Solution #1: cronjob copies config files to git folder and pushes on regular basis
	- Solution #2: host all config files in one folder and use symbolic links so their related program knows where they are
	- Solution #3: actually research other people's implementations instead of winging it on your own shitty ideas
	- Solution #4: forget you even made this repo and leave it with 2 files and this readme
